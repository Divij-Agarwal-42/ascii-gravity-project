**Project Description:**

The Interactive ASCII Gravity Simulator is an engaging and interactive project that provides users with a unique experience of exploring the effects of gravity and anti-gravity on text made of ascii characters. This fun and educational application allow users to input alphabets and watch as they come to life on the screen, influenced by the force of gravity.

**Key Features:**

1. **User Input:** Users can type alphabetic characters, which will be displayed on the screen as ASCII art.

2. **Gravity Simulation:** The program uses physics-based algorithms to apply gravitational forces to the characters, causing them to fall naturally toward the bottom of the screen.

4. **Interactive Controls:** Intuitive controls provide users with the ability to adjust the strength and direction of gravity.

5. **Customization:** Users can personalize their experience by customizing the color of the characters and the background.


**Programming Languages:** This project has been implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
