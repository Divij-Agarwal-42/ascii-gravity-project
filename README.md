**Project Title:** Interactive ASCII Gravity Simulator

**Project Description:**

The Interactive ASCII Gravity Simulator is an engaging and interactive project that provides users with a unique experience of exploring the effects of gravity and anti-gravity on alphabetic characters. This fun and educational application allow users to input alphabets and watch as they come to life on the screen, influenced by the force of gravity. Moreover, a special anti-gravity button enables users to reverse the effects, defying gravity and observing the characters ascend.

**Key Features:**

1. **User Input:** Users can type or select alphabetic characters, which will be displayed on the screen as ASCII art.

2. **Realistic Gravity Simulation:** The program uses physics-based algorithms to apply gravitational forces to the characters, causing them to fall naturally toward the bottom of the screen.

3. **Anti-Gravity Mode:** A dedicated button or control allows users to toggle an "anti-gravity" mode, where characters rise against the force of gravity, creating a captivating visual effect.

4. **Interactive Controls:** Intuitive controls provide users with the ability to adjust the strength of gravity, alter character sizes, and experiment with different fonts and colors.

5. **Customization:** Users can personalize their experience by customizing the appearance of the characters and the background.

6. **Educational Value:** The project serves as an educational tool to illustrate the principles of gravity and physics in an engaging and interactive manner, making it suitable for both classrooms and casual users.
